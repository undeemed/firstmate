# Orca Backend

Orca is an experimental runtime backend for firstmate.
It is distinct from the crewmate harness: the harness is the agent process firstmate launches (`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `pi`, or `grok`), while Orca owns the task worktree and terminal endpoint underneath that process.

## Status

PR #210 landed the primitive Orca terminal adapter: bounded capture, text send, Enter, Ctrl-C interrupt, and close for already-created Orca terminals.
This follow-up adds full ship/scout task lifecycle support for `backend=orca`: spawn, metadata, send/peek/watch/crew-state routing from metadata, and guarded teardown through Orca.

Orca remains explicit-only.
Select it with `fm-spawn.sh --backend orca`, `FM_BACKEND=orca`, or local `config/backend`.
It is not auto-detected from the current process environment.
Before spawn mutates any repo/worktree state, firstmate runs `orca status --json` and requires the Orca runtime to report reachable/ready.

## Task Shape

An Orca task is one Orca-managed git worktree plus one Orca terminal.
Unlike `tmux`, `herdr`, and `zellij`, Orca is not only a session provider; it also provides the task worktree, so `fm-spawn.sh` does not run `treehouse get` for Orca tasks.

The normal firstmate invariant still applies: a ship or scout task must run outside the project primary checkout, and teardown must refuse to discard unlanded ship work.

## Metadata

An Orca-spawned task records the normal task fields plus these Orca-specific fields:

```text
backend=orca
window=fm-<id>
terminal=<orca terminal handle>
orca_worktree_id=<orca worktree id>
worktree=<absolute path to the Orca-created git worktree>
```

`window=` remains the shared firstmate selector field used by `fm-peek.sh`, `fm-send.sh`, `fm-watch.sh`, `fm-crew-state.sh`, and `fm-teardown.sh`.
For Orca, `window=` keeps the stable firstmate alias while `terminal=` carries the stable Orca terminal handle that backend operations use.
The recorded `backend=orca` field tells shared call sites to route capture, send, interrupt, and close through `bin/backends/orca.sh` instead of tmux assumptions.

## Lifecycle

Spawn:

1. Ensure the project repo is registered in Orca, adding it with `orca repo add --path` when needed.
2. Create an independent Orca worktree with `orca worktree create --repo id:<repo> --name fm-<id> --no-parent --setup skip`.
3. Reuse the terminal returned by Orca worktree creation when present, or create a titled terminal in that worktree when Orca returns only the worktree.
4. Install firstmate's per-harness turn-end hooks in the Orca worktree.
5. Write metadata, then send `GOTMPDIR` export and the selected harness launch through the recorded Orca terminal.

Operation routing:

- `fm-peek.sh` captures with `orca terminal read`.
- `fm-send.sh` types text with `orca terminal send --text ...`, submits with Enter, and verifies the composer row cleared before returning; when Orca reports a limited page, the verifier follows `oldestCursor` and preserves the current tail so older text cannot hide still-pending composer input.
- `fm-send.sh --key Enter` and `--key C-c` are supported.
- `fm-watch.sh` treats Orca as a pull backend with no native busy-state primitive, so it falls back to the same terminal-tail busy regex used for tmux and zellij.
- `fm-crew-state.sh` reads the recorded Orca terminal when no no-mistakes run-step applies.

Teardown:

- Scout teardown still requires `data/<id>/report.md` unless `--force` is explicitly used.
- Ship teardown still refuses dirty or unlanded work before any terminal/worktree cleanup.
- Ship teardown resolves `orca_worktree_id` back through Orca and verifies it matches the inspected `worktree=` path before removing anything; mismatches or uninspectable paths preserve metadata and fail closed.
- After the existing firstmate safety checks pass, teardown closes the recorded Orca terminal and releases the recorded worktree through `orca worktree rm --worktree id:<orca_worktree_id> --force`.
- Teardown does not raw-delete Orca worktrees.

## Limitations

- `--secondmate` spawns still refuse `backend=orca`; secondmate-home semantics need a separate design.
- Escape is unsupported because the current Orca terminal send primitive exposes Enter and interrupt-style input but no verified Escape operation.
- Orca is explicit-only and is not selected by runtime auto-detection.
- Orca currently exposes no stable CLI version or protocol marker. Unlike the herdr/zellij docs, this backend intentionally gates spawn support on runtime reachability from `orca status --json` rather than a version floor.

## Verification

Real-Orca smoke verification was run against `/usr/local/bin/orca` with `/Applications/Orca.app` reporting bundle version `1.4.116`; `orca status --json` reported `result.runtime.reachable=true` and `result.runtime.state="ready"`.
The verified terminal creation handle field is `result.terminal.handle` from `orca terminal create --json`; worktree creation returned `result.worktree.id` and `result.worktree.path` in the same smoke run.

Fake-Orca tests cover:

- helper parsing for repo registration, worktree creation, implicit-terminal reuse, terminal creation, terminal sends, and worktree removal;
- runtime readiness gating through `orca status --json`;
- `fm-spawn.sh --backend orca` metadata creation and harness launch;
- `fm-peek.sh`, `fm-send.sh`, and `fm-crew-state.sh` routing through recorded Orca metadata;
- scout teardown releasing an Orca worktree through `orca worktree rm`;
- ship teardown failing closed when the recorded Orca worktree id is missing, cannot resolve to a path, or resolves to a different path than `worktree=`.
