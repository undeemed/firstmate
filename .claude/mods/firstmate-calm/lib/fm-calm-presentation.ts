// Firstmate Calm presentation policy for the Claude Code mod, kept free of the engine.
//
// This module owns the decisions ../hooks/register.ts applies through `$`: where the
// shared per-home Calm preference lives and how its value reads, which assistant text is
// a mid-turn working note, and which transcript rows Calm hides. It mirrors the Pi
// policy in .pi/extensions/lib/fm-calm-visibility.ts and .pi/extensions/fm-calm.ts:
// genuine user prompts, genuine agent responses, and working activity stay visible;
// tool rows, tool groups, working notes, and canonically classified operational user
// rows hide. docs/calm.md owns the captain-facing contract and docs/configuration.md
// the persisted preference schema. Everything here is pure so tests run it under Node.
