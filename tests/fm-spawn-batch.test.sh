#
# These exercise argument routing only: each spawn attempt fails fast at the
# missing-brief check, which is reached before any tmux/treehouse side effect, so
# the tests create no windows or worktrees. FM_SPAWN_NO_GUARD=1 keeps them off the
# live watcher guard / state. Parser and path-scoping cases are table-driven; the
# only behavior asserted on its own is "a multi-pair batch does not stop after the
# first failure".
