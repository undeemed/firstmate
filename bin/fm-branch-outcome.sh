#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-branch-outcome.sh - the durable outcome store for the Pi supervision
# branch (docs/pi-supervision-branch.md).
#
# CONTRACT (this header is the one owner of the store's format).
#   - Store: $STATE/branch-outcomes.jsonl, strictly APPEND-ONLY. One JSON
#     object per line: {"seq":N,"epoch":N,"task":"...","wake":"...",
#     "verdict":"routine"|"captain","summary":"...","silent":true|false}.
#     Legacy rows without `silent` remain valid and are treated as visible.
#     Every read and append validates the complete log as a gap-free sequence;
#     malformed, duplicate, or reordered rows fail closed.
#     Existing lines are never rewritten, reordered, or deleted by any
#     subcommand; the read state lives
#     entirely in the cursor sidecar so marking outcomes read cannot disturb
#     the log. Retention: the log is small (one line per handled fleet event)
#     and truncation, if ever needed, is a captain-approved manual act.
#   - Cursor: $STATE/.branch-outcomes-cursor holds the highest seq handed to
#     Pi as a routine merge note, persisted as a sequence-keyed visible captain
#     entry, emitted by the locked session-start replay, or silently consumed
#     there because `silent` is true. Records above the cursor are unread.
#     A captain row advances only after its matching visible entry exists in
#     Pi's session, so reload recovery is idempotent across that crash window.
#     A cursor beyond the validated store tail fails closed.
#   - Processed marker: $STATE/.branch-outcomes-processed holds the highest
#     seq whose captain rows main has ACKNOWLEDGED as processed, separately
#     from the read cursor: reading (the visible entry) is the branch's act,
#     processing (main acting on the outcome and calling its acknowledgement
#     tool) is main's. A captain row between the two markers is "unprocessed":
#     delivered and shown, not yet acted on. Routine rows never wait on this
#     marker. It only advances through an explicit sequence-bound
#     acknowledgement naming a currently unprocessed captain row at or below
#     the read cursor; a routine, unread, or already-processed target is
#     refused. It never moves past the read cursor or backwards, so an
#     unrelated or empty model answer cannot move it. An absent marker reads as
#     0 (every delivered captain row is unprocessed, the safe direction);
#     processed-init is the one-time migration that sets an absent marker to
#     the read cursor so rows delivered before the marker existed are not
#     re-presented. A present marker is validated before the migration returns,
#     and a marker ahead of the read cursor fails closed.
#   - Every mutation runs under $STATE/.branch-outcomes.lock so the branch
#     extension and a concurrent session-start replay cannot interleave.
#   - The store is written BEFORE the outcome is delivered to main
#     (store-first durability): nothing about a handled event depends on
#     conversation memory.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-branch-outcome.sh append --task <id> --verdict routine|captain \
#       --summary <text> [--wake <text>] [--silent true|false]
#     Append one outcome record; prints the assigned seq.
#   fm-branch-outcome.sh unread
#     Print every unread record (raw JSONL). Exit 0 with no output when none.
#   fm-branch-outcome.sh mark-read --through <seq>
#     Advance the cursor (never backwards) after handing the records to Pi.
#   fm-branch-outcome.sh unprocessed
#     Print every captain record that is read but not yet processed (raw
#     JSONL, ascending seq). Exit 0 with no output when none.
#   fm-branch-outcome.sh mark-processed --through <seq>
#     Advance the processed marker after main acknowledged the captain rows
#     through <seq>; the target itself must be a currently unprocessed captain
#     row at or below the read cursor.
#   fm-branch-outcome.sh processed-init
#     Create the processed marker at the current read cursor when it does not
#     exist yet; validate a present marker without changing it.
#   fm-branch-outcome.sh list [--recent <n>]
#     Print the last n records (default 20), read or not.
#   fm-branch-outcome.sh startup-replay
#     Session-start recovery: print the leading routine unread records under a
#     labeled header into the locked startup digest, skip rows whose `silent`
#     field is true, and mark those leading routine rows read. Stop before the
#     first captain row because only Pi's sequence-keyed visible entry may
#     acknowledge that row. Prints nothing when nothing replayable is unread.
#     Run it only when the session holds the lock (fm-session-start.sh owns the
#     call site).
