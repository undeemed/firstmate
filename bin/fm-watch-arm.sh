# Safe, home-scoped (re-)arm of the firstmate watcher.
#
# Default (no args): start bin/fm-watch.sh. The watcher is a singleton per
# FM_HOME, so a second arm no-ops harmlessly when one is already alive. This is
# the primary re-arm model - just arm, never kill, and let the singleton lock
# decide.
#
# --restart: stop ONLY this FM_HOME's watcher and start a fresh one. It resolves
# the pid from THIS home's state/.watch.lock and signals exactly that pid, so it
# can never touch another home's watcher. NEVER use `pkill -f bin/fm-watch.sh`:
# that pattern matches every firstmate home's watcher (secondmate homes run the
# same script) and would kill siblings.
#
# Run this exactly like bin/fm-watch.sh - as a background task. It execs the
# watcher in the foreground, so the harness backgrounds the whole invocation.
